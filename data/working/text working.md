# CHAPTER 8

There are many introductions to the theory of probability and its uses in science and everyday life. One enjoyable and accessible introduction is Olofsson, P. (2015). *Probabilities: The little numbers that rule our lives. John Wiley & Sons. The rapid strep test example in section 8.1 is an example of the base-rate fallacy (cf., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy), which is discussed, among many others, by Gigerenzer, G., & Edwards, A. (2003). Simple tools for understanding risks: From innumeracy to insight. BMJ, 327 (7417), 741–744. The estimates we refer to about the carriage rate of strep (Streptococcus pharyngitis) can be found in: Martin, J. (2016). The Streptococcus pyogenes carrier state. In J. J. Ferretti, D. L.

# CHAPTER 10

There are many introductions to statistical reasoning. Relevant to the content of this chapter and Chapter 9 is Freedman, D., Pisani, R., & Purves, R. (2007). *Statistics (4th ed.). W. W. Norton & Company. A helpful, free, online textbook is Daniel Lakens’s Improving your statistical inferences. The discovery of the Higgs boson described in section 10.1 is by Chatrchyan, S., Khachatryan, V., Sirunyan, A. M., Tumasyan, A., Adam, W., Aguilo, E., . . . Friedl, M. (2012). Observation of a new boson at a mass of 125 GeV with the CMS experiment at the LHC. Physics Letters B, 716(1), 30–61. The 68–95–99.7 rule we cover in section 10.2 is explained in more detail in Pukelsheim, F. (1994). The three sigma rule. The American Statistician, 48(2), 88–91. Our discussion of confidence intervals on page is especially indebted to Hoekstra, R., Morey, R. D., Rouder, J. N., & Wagenmakers, E. J. (2014). Robust misinterpretation of confidence intervals. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 21(5), 1157–1164. The example of nonrandom sampling relies on Squire, P. (1988). Why the 1936 Literary Digest poll failed. Public Opinion Quarterly, 52(1), 125–133. The tea tasting experiment described in section 10.3 is from Fisher, R. A. (1956). Mathematics of a lady tasting tea. In J. R. Newman (Ed.), The world of mathematics (pp. 1512–1521). Simon & Schuster. (Original work published in Fisher, R. A. (1935). The design of experiments. Oliver and Boyd.) The discussion of statistical significance is indebted especially to Gelman, A., & Stern, H. (2006). The difference between “significant” and “not significant” is not itself statistically significant. The American Statistician, 60(4), 328–331. For the association between genes and smoking behavior, see Thorgeirsson, T. E., Gudbjartsson, D. F., Surakka, I., Vink, J. M., Amin, N., Geller, F., . . . Gieger, C. (2010). Sequence variants at CHRNB3-CHRNA6 and CYP2A6 affect smoking behavior. Nature Genetics, 42(5), 448–453. The criticism in section 10.4 that NHST says nothing about the probability different hypotheses are true is partly based on work by Cohen, J. (1994). The earth is round (p < .05). American Psychologist, 49(12), 997–1003. The second criticism of NHST is partly based on Lindley, D. V. (1993). The analysis of experimental data: The appreciation of tea and wine. Teaching Statistics, 15, 22–25. The problem of the prior we discuss is based on Gelman, A., & Hennig, C. (2017). Beyond subjective and objective in statistics (with discussion).

Evidence about the bearing of cash transfers on temptation goods is discussed in Evans, D. K., & Popova, A. (2017). Cash transfers and temptation goods. *Economic Development and Cultural Change*, 65(2), 189–221.

One of the major works in philosophy, where Hume engaged with questions about causation, is Hume, D. (1738/2007). *A treatise of human nature* (D. F. Norton & M. J. Norton, Eds.). Clarendon Press.

Evidence that “poverty in childhood can have effects much later in life, and poverty rates are influenced by geopolitical events that occur far away in time and space” is presented in Duncan, G. J., Magnuson, K., & Votruba-Drzal, E. (2017). Moving beyond correlations in assessing the consequences of poverty. *Annual Review of Psychology*, 68, 413–434.

One key reference for the difference making account of causation in section 11.2 is Woodward, J. (2003). *Making things happen: A theory of causal explanation*. Oxford University Press.

One reference on physical process theories of causation is Salmon, W. (1984). *Scientific explanation and the causal structure of the world*. Princeton University Press.

The methods presented in Box 11.3 were originally developed in Mill, J. S. (1893). *A system of logic, ratiocinative and inductive: Being a connected view of the principles of evidence and the methods of scientific investigation*. Harper & brothers.

The scenario described in section 11.4 is a direct quotation from page 30 of Korb, K., & Nicholson, A. (2010). *Bayesian artificial intelligence* (2nd ed.). Chapman & Hall/CRC.

Scientific applications of Bayes nets are explained and discussed in more detail in e.g. Glymour, C. (2007). When is a brain like the planet? *Philosophy of Science*, 74(3), 330–347.

The example of the two lamps and the principle of common cause is from Reichenbach, H. (1956). *The direction of time* (p. 157). University of California Press.

Many cases of “spurious” correlations often explained by the presence of some common cause are discussed in Vigen, T. (2015). *Spurious correlations*. Hachette Books.

Several fun examples of spurious correlations are also available at the website: www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations.
