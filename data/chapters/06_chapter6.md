## CHAPTER 6 Deductive reasoning

### 6.1 THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE AND SCIENTIFIC ARGUMENTS

After reading this section, you should be able to:

- Summarize Hubble’s three scientific arguments regarding the size, expansion, and age of the universe
- Define reasoning, inference, premise, conclusion, and argument and describe the relationships among these concepts
- Describe the nature of a valid deductive argument

#### How old is the universe?

In Chapter 1, we mentioned Clair Patterson’s involvement in the campaign to remove lead from gasoline because of lead’s disastrous health effects. Patterson was a geochemist; using radiometric dating methods on elements like uranium and lead, he correctly calculated that our planet Earth is 4.5 billion years old. If the Earth is that old, how much older is the universe itself?

This question has been asked for a very long time, and answers to it have, of course, changed with advancing knowledge. The philosopher Aristotle argued that the universe must be eternal. He reasoned that everything which comes into existence requires some preexisting matter from which it comes. (You may have heard of the saying *ex nihilo nihil fit*, which is the similar idea that from nothing comes nothing.) This implies that if the universe came into existence, then it came into existence from some preexisting matter. But this is not possible if the universe is the totality of what there is. Further, any preexisting matter must have itself come from some other prior matter. The result is an infinite regress: no starting point is possible. Aristotle concluded that the universe must be eternal.

From the early Middle Ages to the end of the Renaissance, roughly the 7th through 16th centuries, scholars and theologians in Europe, the Mediterranean Basin, and the Middle East continued to engage with questions about the age of the universe. The structure of Aristotle’s reasoning was largely kept, but the eternality of the universe was replaced by the eternality of God in order to fit with ideas about religious creation.

Some theologians estimated the universe to have come into existence around 4,000 BCE—that is, about 6,000 years ago. The estimate was derived from arithmetical calculations from genealogical records in various religious texts.

By the 19th century, many scientists believed that the universe—whatever its age—is in a steady state. In the 1920s, Edwin Hubble made two discoveries that were inconsistent with that belief: first, that the universe is much larger than previously thought and, second, that the universe is expanding. These discoveries also provided new evidence about the age of the universe.

Using a telescope with a 2.5‐meter aperture at Mount Wilson Observatory in Southern California, Hubble observed Andromeda, an astronomical entity visible to the naked eye and identified over 1,000 years ago. He saw stars similar to those nearer to Earth, only dimmer. One of those stars is called a Cepheid variable, a star whose brightness changes periodically. The period of time it takes a Cepheid’s brightness to change is related to the star’s luminosity, the amount of energy it emits in one second.

From the star’s periodicity and that relationship, Hubble could calculate the star’s luminosity, thereby determining how much brighter it was than the Sun. Hubble then used his knowledge of the speed of light, which Einstein had recently shown to be constant, and the apparent brightness of the star compared to what he had calculated to be its luminosity to calculate the star’s distance from Earth. Based on the distance of that star, Hubble reasoned that Andromeda is actually a different galaxy from our Milky Way galaxy. This discovery of a separate galaxy, announced in 1925, confirmed that the universe is much larger than previously thought.

Hubble also discovered that the universe has not always been this large. It’s expanding. Like sound, light changes its frequency depending on the relative movement of the object emitting it and the observer. An example is the change in frequency of an ambulance siren as it moves toward, and then away, from an observer. The siren’s pitch sounds higher as it approaches, and then lower pitched as it passes. This frequency change, called the Doppler effect, was discovered in the mid‐19th century by the Austrian physicist Christian Doppler. For Hubble’s purposes, the important implication is that a star moving away from Earth appears redder, while a star moving toward Earth appears bluer. The degree of redness of receding stars is called redshift.

Using the technique of astronomical spectroscopy, Hubble discovered that the redshift of starlight from any galaxy increased in proportion to the galaxy’s distance from Earth. In 1929, he announced his discovery that galaxies are moving farther and farther away from Earth. By implication, the universe itself is expanding. According to recent estimates, the universe’s expansion rate, known as Hubble’s constant, is about 68 kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/sec/Mpc), where one megaparsec (Mpc) is approximately three million light‐years—an extremely long distance!

How do Hubble’s discoveries about the size and expansion of our universe help determine its age? As we’ve seen, knowledge of the speed of light and a star’s brightness can be used to calculate the distances to faraway stars and galaxies. This distance measurement in turn indicates the amount of time the star must have been producing light in order for that light to reach Earth. Observing light from very distant stars and galaxies thus indicates their minimum age as well as the minimum age of the universe containing them. Using this reasoning, Hubble was able to show that the universe was at least 10 billion years old.

More recently, revised estimates suggest that the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years old. In 2020, astrophysicists used the 6‐meter‐aperture Atacama Cosmology Telescope in Chile to confirm this estimate and give a more precise estimate of the value. This finding has also been supported by convergent evidence from sciences like cosmological physics and geochemistry. The newest successor to the Hubble telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, is set to provide additional confirmation of the universe’s age.

#### Reasoning, inference, and argument

In past chapters, we have seen that empirical evidence is essential for developing scientific knowledge. But for observations to lead to knowledge, scientists must assess their significance and implications, and the relationships among them. In other words, scientific knowledge comes not from mere observation but from reasoning about observations. Hubble combined empirical observations with calculations of light’s travel over distances and through time, established scientific knowledge about the Doppler effect, and other resources to develop arguments in favor of his conclusions regarding the universe’s size, its expansion, and its age. Hubble appealed to empirical evidence in ways Aristotle did not, but like Aristotle, he also had to reason his way to conclusions.

This chapter and the next focus on inference patterns in scientific reasoning. Reasoning is a cognitive process of drawing inferences in support of some conclusion. An inference is a logical transition from one thought to another. Inferences move from premises, statements that provide support, to conclusions, statements that are supported by the premises. Inferences from premise(s) to conclusion(s) can be depicted as abstract derivations obeying rules that capture the logical transition(s) involved. So, while reasoning is a cognitive process, inferences can be thought of as simply logical relationships.

Reasoning processes can be made explicit by depicting inferences explicitly in an argument. While “argument” means different things in different contexts, here an argument is a set of statements in which some (premises) are intended to provide rational support or empirical evidence in favor of another (the conclusion). Recall Aristotle’s reasons for concluding that the universe is eternal. These reasons can be reconstructed into the following argument:

1. Everything that comes into existence must come from some prior material substrate.
2. ∴ If the universe came into existence, then the universe must have come from just such a prior substrate.
3. It cannot be the case that some prior material substrate existed before the universe.
4. ∴ It cannot be that the universe came into existence.
5. ∴ The universe is eternal.

The argument is an ordered list of statements. The first four statements are the premises; the argument’s conclusion is the last statement. Statements inferred from one or more premises are sometimes marked with the symbol ∴, which is notation for words like therefore, so, or hence. As this example shows, an argument may involve more than one inference. Here the second statement is inferred as an application of the first statement. The fourth statement is inferred from the second and third statement together. And the final conclusion is inferred from the fourth claim.

Scientific reasoning is similar to ordinary everyday reasoning but focused specifically on developing natural explanations for natural phenomena. Arguments in science also tend to incorporate empirical evidence. And then, scientific reasoning also tends to be more explicit than everyday reasoning, in part because scientists need to be able to assess each other’s reasoning.

**Logic** is the study of the rules and patterns of inference, which is crucial for evaluating scientific reasoning. Scientific reasoning can follow three patterns of inference: deductive, inductive, and abductive. The evaluation of each of these patterns of inferences focuses on two main questions: first, do the premises rationally support the conclusion? And second, are those premises true? The premises of a good inference should provide a logically compelling reason for thinking the conclusion either must be true or is likely to be true. In a deductive argument, the truth of the premises should guarantee the truth of the conclusion, while in inductive and abductive arguments, the premises provide support for the conclusion but do not guarantee its truth. This chapter focuses on deductive inference; Chapter 7 addresses inductive and abductive inference.

Again, in a deductive argument, the truth of the premises should guarantee the truth of the conclusion. If so, the argument is said to be valid. In nontechnical uses, “valid” can mean that something is believable, and, in Chapter 3, we discussed the external and internal validity of experiments. Here, in the context of deduction, validity has a different meaning. In a valid inference, the truth of the premises logically guarantees the truth of the conclusion. For a valid deductive argument or inference, it is impossible for the conclusion to be false provided that all premises are true.

##### EXERCISES

6.1: Recall: How did Hubble discover that galaxies are moving farther and farther away from Earth? Describe the observation(s) he made supporting this discovery and his reasoning based on the observations.

6.2: Recall: Briefly summarize Hubble’s scientific arguments regarding the size and age of the universe. For each of the two, start by identifying the conclusion, and then piece together his reasoning for that conclusion. You don’t need to put these in explicit premises that comprise a valid deductive argument, but you are welcome to use that approach if it is helpful.

6.3: Think: Aristotle reasoned that the universe did not become and has always been. His argument for that conclusion as enumerated in statements (1)–(5) in this section is a valid deductive argument; so if all the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. But we know the conclusion is false, and so at least one of the premises must be false. Which of the premises might be false? Describe your reasoning.

6.4: Apply: Hubble discovered that the universe is expanding from changes in redshift. Describe what changes he observed. If, in the future, the universe began to contract, what changes in redshift should scientists expect to see? How long after the universe began to contract would scientists see this change?

6.5: Recall: Define reasoning, inference, premise, conclusion, and argument and describe the relationships among reasoning, inference, and argument, as well as the relationships among premise, conclusion, and argument (or inference).

6.6: Recall: What is required for a deductive argument to be valid? Give a simple example of a valid deductive argument—about anything!—numbering the statements and indicating conclusion(s) with ∴.

 

### 6.2 RULES OF DEDUCTIVE INFERENCE

After reading this section, you should be able to:

- Define conditional statement, antecedent, and consequent and indicate the logical relationships among them
- Identify these common patterns of valid and invalid deductive inference: affirming the antecedent, denying the consequent, affirming the consequent, and denying the antecedent
- Assess an argument’s validity and soundness and, for an invalid or unsound argument, whether the argument should be revised or abandoned

#### Conditional statements

An important component of many deductive inferences is the conditional statement, statements in which one circumstance is given as a condition for another circumstance. These are often thought of as if/then statements: if you eat your vegetable, then you can have dessert. If a star is 13.8 billion light-years away, then the universe is at least 13.8 billion years old. The first circumstance (following “if”) is the antecedent, the condition for the other circumstance, while the second circumstance (following “then”) is the consequent, the circumstance arising from the antecedent.

You can think about the logical relationship between antecedents and consequents in terms of requirements and guarantees—or, more formally, necessary and sufficient conditions. In a true conditional statement, the antecedent is a sufficient condition for the consequent—a condition that, if met, guarantees the occurrence of the specified outcome (here, the consequent). Consider the true conditional statement: “If Lu is a dog, then Lu is an animal.” Lu being a dog guarantees that Lu is also an animal; being a dog is sufficient for being an animal. But this doesn’t work in reverse. In a true conditional statement, the consequent occurring doesn’t guarantee the antecedent will occur. Lu being an animal doesn’t guarantee that he’s a dog; perhaps he’s an alligator or a velociraptor. Instead, the consequent is a necessary condition for the antecedent—a condition that must be satisfied for the occurrence of the specified outcome (here, the antecedent). Lu being an animal is a necessary condition for Lu to be a dog: there’s no way Lu is a dog if he’s not an animal.

The meanings of antecedent and consequent relate to logical priority, not temporal succession. Sometimes an antecedent occurs before its consequent in time, as when a child has to eat their vegetable before being allowed to eat dessert. It’s not good enough for the child to promise they’ll eat the vegetable later. But, for the statement “if Lu is a dog, then Lu is an animal,” being a dog doesn’t come before being an animal; it’s just that being an animal is a consequence of being a dog. The time ordering of antecedents and consequents can also be reversed. In the statement “if you are still hungry, then you must not have eaten enough dinner,” the antecedent is logically prior, even though the consequent (not eating enough dinner) happened before the antecedent (still being hungry).  

##### Box 6.1 Conditional statements

Scientific inquiry and everyday reasoning often involve the formulation and evaluation of conditional statements, like if A then C. But conditional statements often are expressed in nonstandard forms. Instead of if A then C, one might say (where A is still the antecedent and C the consequent of the conditional):

- C if A
- A only if C
- A guarantees C
- Without C, A is not the case
- Not A unless C

And more. Here are some tricks for navigating nonstandard forms of conditional statements:

1. Identify the candidates for being antecedent and consequent: what is being related in the claim?
2. A consequent states a necessary condition for the antecedent, or gives a requirement.
3. An antecedent states a sufficient condition for the consequent, or gives a guarantee.
4. Try to translate the statement into a standard if-then conditional and check if the same circumstances make the sentence true.

Recall that a conditional statement is only false when the antecedent can be true while the consequent is false; in all other cases, the conditional is true. For example, if parents tell their child: “if you eat your broccoli, then you’ll get dessert,” and she eats her broccoli, but then they withhold dessert, they were lying. (Which isn’t a very nice thing to do to a little kid who wants dessert!) But if she doesn’t eat her broccoli, they’ve made no promises about whether she’ll get dessert; what the parents told her is true regardless. This kind of conditional, our focus in this chapter, is called a material conditional.

To summarize, in a conditional claim, the antecedent is a condition that guarantees some consequence; it is logically prior to the consequent. The consequent is the condition that arises from, or is guaranteed by, the antecedent. In an if/then statement, the antecedent follows “if” while the consequent follows “then.”

When Hubble calculated that distant stars were more than 10 billion years old, he knew that the universe itself is at least that old. This can be stated as a conditional: If some stars are more than 10 billion years old, then the universe must be more than 10 billion years old. In other words, a sufficient condition for the universe’s being 10 billion years old is that some stars are 10 billion years old. If the universe were younger, it couldn’t contain any objects that old. The universe being 10 billion years old is thus a requirement for any star to be that old. But again, this doesn’t work in reverse: learning that the universe is a certain age would not guarantee that any star is that old. It’s possible for the oldest stars to be younger than the universe containing them. The universe’s having a given age is a necessary condition for there to be a star of that age, but it’s not a sufficient condition.

#### Valid and sound arguments

Recall from section 6.1 that, in a valid deductive argument, the truth of all premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In other words, the truth of all premises is a sufficient condition for the truth of the conclusion. Deductive arguments for which this is not so are said to be invalid. An invalid deductive argument does not always have a false conclusion. This just means the truth of all premises does not guarantee the conclusion is true. Likewise, a valid deductive argument does not always have a true conclusion. Recall from earlier that Aristotle gave a valid deductive argument for the conclusion that the universe is eternal, but we now believe that conclusion to be false. A valid deductive argument with a false conclusion must have one or more false premises—because if the premises were all true, the conclusion would be as well (or else it’s not a valid argument).

So, to assess whether an argument or inference is valid, assume or stipulate that all premises are true, and then ask whether it’s possible for the conclusion to be false. If not—if the truth of the premises alone guarantees the truth of the conclusion—the inference is valid. But if this is possible, the inference is invalid. Deductive inferences cannot be made more valid, or rendered invalid, by adding more premises. Deductive inferences are thus monotonic inferences: inferences that cannot be invalidated by the addition of new information. Because deductive reasoning is monotonic, it is fully secure in the sense that, if your inferences are valid, you can be absolutely certain that true premises guarantee a true conclusion. (As we will see in Chapter 7, this is not so for inductive or abductive arguments.)

Some patterns of deductive inference are common enough to have names. One such pattern is affirming the antecedent (also known as modus ponens), a valid pattern of deductive inference in which a conditional statement and its antecedent are used as premises for concluding the consequent is true. For example,

​	(1) If the James Webb Space Telescope is at the second Lagrange point, then it will orbit the Sun at 1.5 gigameters from Earth.

​	(2) The James Webb Space Telescope is at the second Lagrange point.

​	∴ (3) It will orbit the Sun at 1.5 gigameters from Earth.  

(A Lagrange point is a location where an object is equally influenced by two orbiting bodies, in this case the Sun and Earth.) The conditional statement of the relationship between the second Lagrange point and orbital distance holds regardless of where the telescope is in fact located; the observation of the telescope’s location at this Lagrange point then makes the antecedent of the conditional true such that the consequent also must be true. The conclusion is, thus, just a statement asserting the consequent.

Another elementary pattern of deductive inference is denying the consequent (also known as modus tollens), a valid pattern of deductive inference in which a conditional statement and the denial of its consequent are used as premises for concluding the antecedent is also false. For example,

​	(1) If the universe is in a steady state, then astral bodies remain the same distance from one another.

​	(2) Astral bodies do not remain the same distance from one another.

​	∴ (3) The universe is not in a steady state.

In this argument, the conditional statement relating the universe’s state to relative distances of astral bodies enables an observation of increasing distance between astral bodies (as evident from changes in redshift) to be used to conclude something about the universe—namely, that it is not in a steady state but expanding.

Any arguments following these two patterns are deductively valid. The premises may not be true, of course. But if they were true, they would logically guarantee that the conclusion must also be true. No matter how long and deep you think, you will not be able to find an instance of either pattern that is invalid.

Keep in mind that a valid deductive argument is more than premises and a conclusion that are all true. To have a valid inference, the truth of the premises must logically force the conclusion to be true; there must be no way around having a true conclusion if the premises are true. Consider this argument:

1. Cats are mammals.
2. Tigers are mammals.
3. ∴ Tigers are cats.

Both premises are true, and so is the conclusion. But the inference is invalid. Even though all three statements are true, the truth of the conclusion isn’t guaranteed by the truth of the premises. To see this, substitute in dogs for cats in the argument; the two premises will still be true, but not the conclusion.

##### Box 6.2 Different kinds of logic

Formal logic is the study of the rules governing what can validly be inferred from a set of claims. The study of logic is deeply related to mathematics and computer science, where researchers also explore formal relations between sets of claims. Two rules of deductive logic we’ve encountered are affirming the antecedent (modus ponens) and denying the consequent (modus tollens). Both rules are valid, since the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.

Formal logic employs fully precise rules like these. Yet natural languages (English and all other languages used around the world) are not fully precise. Ideas expressed in natural language can sometimes be interpreted in different ways. This means there are choices to make in how to define the precise rules of formal logic. Different choices result in different systems of formal logic.

For instance, the most common logic system, called classical logic, has an assumption called the law of the excluded middle. This law stipulates that, for every claim, either the claim is true or its negation is true. For example, if it is not true that the grass is green, then it is true that the grass is not green. In many cases, the excluded-middle assumption accurately reflects how we reason in natural language. But sometimes it seems to go wrong. For example, it’s not obvious that, if it’s not true that it’s raining, then it’s definitely not raining. Perhaps it’s sprinkling out, but we wouldn’t yet call it rain. Other systems of logic make different assumptions to recognize this possibility, making it possible for a sentence to be neither true nor false or a sentence to be both true and false. These systems of nonclassical logic thus reject the law of the excluded middle.

So invalid arguments can have true premises and conclusions, while valid arguments can have false premises and conclusions. Successful deductive inferences are those that combine both validity and truth. A sound inference is a valid deductive inference with all true premises. If you know both that all premises are true and that the inference is valid, then you know that the conclusion must be true. No additional evidence or reasoning can change that. If it does, then either you didn’t actually have a valid deductive inference, or you didn’t actually know that all the premises are true. (Or something changed such that a premise that had been true became false.) If scientists know some inference is sound, they can be certain that the conclusion is true beyond a shadow of a doubt.

#### Uncovering bad arguments

Being persuaded is a psychological phenomenon. People can fall for bad arguments or may be unpersuaded by good ones. But whether a deductive inference is good—valid and sound—is simply a matter of logic and truth.

A valid deductive argument is unsound if one or more of its premises is false. An argument is invalid, as we’ve seen, if the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. You can show that an argument is invalid by giving a counterexample: a situation, real or imagined, in which the premises of an argument are true but the conclusion false. Even if the situation could never really occur, describing it shows the argument is invalid, as the premises being true alone can’t guarantee the truth of the conclusion.

To evaluate a deductive argument, one should determine whether either of these criticisms apply: is the argument invalid? Is one or more premise false? Here, psychological reasoning intersects with logical inference. If an argument is faulty on one or both of these grounds, consider whether it can be repaired by replacing any false premises with true ones or whether additional premises could be supplied that render the inference to the conclusion valid. Sometimes promising arguments are not yet successful. Other times, an argument is confused, misleading, or just wrong and simply should be rejected.

The valid inference patterns involving conditional statements discussed earlier—affirming the antecedent and denying the consequent—have related invalid inference patterns that result from confusing the roles of necessary and sufficient conditions in conditional statements. Denying the antecedent is an invalid pattern of deductive inference in which a conditional statement and the denial of its antecedent are used as premises for concluding the consequent is also false. Here is an argument that commits the error of denying the antecedent:

1. If a star is more than 15 billion years old, then so too is the universe.
2. No star is more than 15 billion years old.
3. ∴ The universe is not more than 15 billion years old.

This is an invalid argument. Even if the first two premises are true, that’s no guarantee that the conclusion must also be true. The first premise indicates that the age of the oldest star is just a minimum age for the universe. If the conditional statement is true, the antecedent guarantees the consequent but not the other way around. So, denying the antecedent, as the second premise does, provides no good reason to believe the consequent is the case, but it doesn’t demonstrate that the consequent is not the case, either.

Affirming the consequent is an invalid pattern of deductive inference in which a conditional statement and its consequent are used as premises for concluding the antecedent is true. Here is an argument that commits the error of affirming the consequent:

1. If Andromeda is 13.8 billion light-years away, then the universe is at least 13.8 billion years old.
2. The universe is 13.8 billion years old.
3. ∴ Andromeda is 13.8 billion light-years away.

This is also an invalid argument. Both premises are true, but, again, they don’t guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Some specific astral body viewed from Earth being 13.8 billion light-years away does imply that the universe is at least 13.8 billion years old, but the universe being that age doesn’t guarantee the age of any particular astral body. In fact, Andromeda is around 2.5 million light-years away.

##### Box 6.3 The Wason selection task

Suppose you see four cards on a table. You know the cards have letters on one side and numbers on the other, and the sides you see show these symbols:

- A
- K
- 4
- 7

Consider this claim: “If a card has a vowel on one side, then that card has an even number on the other side.” Which card(s) do you have to flip over to evaluate whether the claim is true? Briefly write down which of the cards you would flip.

If you are like most people, you chose the card showing the A and maybe also the card showing the 4. But, according to the rules of deductive logic, to test a conditional claim, you should look for circumstances where the antecedent is true but the consequent is false—so you should have chosen the A and the 7. Rules from logic are sometimes used as standards of rationality in psychology research. While these standards are useful to generate predictions of how idealized agents should reason, it’s a matter of debate whether deviations from these standards are a sign of irrationality. A common example comes from people’s answers to this problem, called the Wason selection task. Deviations between ideal standards of rationality and real human reasoning raise fundamental questions about what it means to be rational and whether deductive logic provides us with the right normative standards for interpreting human reasoning. Interestingly, most people get the Wason selection task right if the question relates more to everyday experience. When you ask which of the following people’s IDs should be checked to ensure no one under 21 drinks alcohol, most get the answer right—and the deductive logic is exactly the same.

The defects in reasoning seen thus far are with the form of the inference. But sometimes the problem with an inference is empirical rather than logical. Sometimes, even when an argument is valid, the world doesn’t cooperate with the statements made about it. This is one place where the detective work of science comes in. For example, consider the following argument:

1. The word atom means indivisible.
2. If the word atom means indivisible, then atoms are indivisible.
3. If atoms are indivisible, then atoms are the smallest type of matter.

∴ Atoms are the smallest type of matter.

This argument involves multiple instances of affirming the antecedent—a valid inference pattern. Given the first two premises, it follows that atoms are indivisible; and from the conjunction of that claim with the third premise, it follows that atoms are the smallest type of matter. This argument is valid. The problem, of course, is that scientists have discovered particles even smaller than atoms. Electrons were discovered in 1897, followed by the discoveries of protons, neutrons, neutrinos, positrons, muons, bosons, and hadrons, which are all smaller than atoms. These discoveries show the conclusion to be false: atoms are not the smallest type of matter. So, the argument is unsound. But because the argument is valid, learning that the conclusion is false also tells us that at least one of the three premises is also false. Can you figure out which one?

#### Bad reasons to reject inferences

Being wary of invalid inference patterns and potentially false premises can help detect bad arguments. But these logical and empirical reasons to challenge some arguments should be distinguished from the negative psychological reactions that some arguments can evoke. For instance, whether someone finds the conclusion of an argument distasteful, offensive, or disagreeable is irrelevant to whether that conclusion is true. The conclusion that global warming is caused by human activity is politically and financially inconvenient for fossil fuel industries. This inconvenience has motivated them to try to subvert the scientific research leading to this conclusion, and they’ve been incredibly successful at sowing doubt about climate change. Taking a leaf from the Big Tobacco playbook used to instill doubt about cigarettes causing cancer in the mid‐20th century, their disinformation campaigns often point to the mere occurrence of disagreement as a reason for doubting climate change, regardless of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

Some scientific reasoning can be counterintuitive or difficult to understand. By itself, this isn’t grounds for rejection. People with limited exposure to evolutionary theory may find it difficult to imagine the course of evolution from single‐celled organisms to humans. Similarly, without training in physics and cosmology, it can be difficult to comprehend the universe being billions of years old and expanding out from an initial Big Bang. But evolutionary theory and cosmological research provide solid grounds for accepting the truth of these bewildering claims—based on convergent evidence from many sources and sound arguments developed from that data. Just as a claim’s intuitiveness isn’t a guide to its truth, an argument’s difficulty or complexity is irrelevant to the goodness of its inferential structure. Likewise, concluding that intelligent design must be true because there is no evidence proving that there is no supernatural intelligent creator is a bad argument; this is called an appeal to ignorance.

Some people contend that the scientific estimate of the age of the universe is “just an opinion.” Similarly, skeptics of evolutionary theory love to claim that it is “just a theory” that biological species evolved from a common ancestor. These are poor objections. Natural phenomena, and natural explanations of those phenomena, are not simply a matter of opinion. And scientific theories are developed on the basis of a tremendous amount of confirming evidence and careful inference. These criticisms are not based on disagreements about evidence or the logic of arguments but instead appeal to the trivial fact that people have different ideas about some things. Ideas that are supported by evidence and sound inference should be taken seriously.

##### EXERCISES

6.7: Recall: Give an example of a conditional statement. Label the antecedent and the consequent, and state which is a necessary condition and which is a sufficient condition.

6.8: Think: The following statements concern necessary and sufficient conditions. For each statement, rephrase it as a standard if/then conditional statement and state whether it’s true or false.

1. Being a mammal is a sufficient condition for being human.
2. Being human is a sufficient condition for being an animal.
3. Being alive is a necessary condition for having a right to life.
4. Being alive is a sufficient condition for having a right to life.
5. Having a PhD is necessary to become a scientist.
6. It’s sufficient for being awarded the Nobel Prize in immunology that one cures cancer.

6.9: Recall: Write out an example of each of these argument patterns in standard form (numbered statements with the conclusion last, introduced by “∴”) and then label each as valid or invalid: affirming the consequent; denying the antecedent; denying the consequent; affirming the antecedent. For the valid patterns, give a short justification for the validity. For the invalid patterns, give a counterexample.

6.10: Apply: Review Hubble’s scientific arguments about the size, expansion, and age of the universe in section 6.1. Identify an inference that fits the pattern of affirming the antecedent and an inference that fits the pattern of denying the consequent. Write each out in standard form. (One option: consider inferences leading to the conclusions that (a) the universe is expanding and (b) Andromeda is not part of our galaxy.)

6.11 Recall: List at least two good reasons to reject inferences and at least three bad reasons to reject inferences, providing justification for each being good or bad.

6.12 Apply: The following argument is invalid, but if one premise is added, it becomes a valid argument. Add a premise that makes the argument valid, and then assess the quality of the revised argument, considering the truth of each premise and the pattern of each inference.

 	1. If a star is 13.8 billion light-years away, then the universe is at least 13.8 billion years old.
 	2. If the universe came into existence 6,000 years ago, then it is not 13.8 billion years old.

### 6.3 DEDUCTIVE REASONING IN HYPOTHESIS-TESTING

After reading this section, you should be able to:

- Define hypothetico-deductive method
- Analyze an instance of hypothesis‐testing using the H‐D method
- Describe how the Duhem‐Quine problem complicates the H‐D method

#### The hypothetico-deductive method

Hypothesis‐testing is a central component of scientific research. Chapters 3 – 5 focused on several strategies for gaining empirical evidence to test hypotheses, but in this chapter, we’ve seen that testing hypotheses also requires rational inference to see how empirical evidence bears on hypotheses. One way of thinking about the inferential relationship between evidence and hypotheses is the hypothetico‐deductive method, or H‐D method. This applies the logic of deductive inference to hypothesis testing.

In general, hypothesis‐testing involves establishing expectations from a hypothesis, and then comparing those expectations with observations. For the hypothetico-deductive method, an expectation is deductively inferred from the hypothesis, and then the expectation is compared with an observation. Violation of the expectation deductively refutes the hypothesis, while a match with the expectation nondeductively boosts support for the hypothesis.

The first use of deductive inference in the H‐D method is in the relationship between hypothesis and expectation. This involves determining what to expect if the hypothesis under investigation is true. That relationship can be expressed as a conditional statement with the hypothesis as the antecedent and the expectation as the consequent: “if H, then E.” We don’t yet know whether the hypothesis is true, but we do know that if the hypothesis is true, then the expectation will be true. This conditional statement can be thought of as an answer to the question: “if this hypothesis is true, what must the world be like?” Recall Hubble’s reasoning about the size of the universe. The then‐accepted hypothesis that the universe is in a steady state leads to the expectation that there would be no pattern in the redshift of stars: if the universe is in a steady state (H), then there’s no pattern in stars’ redshift (E).

After deductively inferring an expectation from a hypothesis, scientists make observations to compare with the expectations. For the H‐D method, deductive inference plays a role in this step as well. If what is observed doesn’t match what was expected, this enables a deductive argument for the conclusion that the hypothesis is false. That is, the observation violates the expectation, which refutes the hypothesis—proves it to be wrong. This is called refutation and can be represented this way:

##### Refutation

1. If H, then E
2. Not E
3. ∴ Not H

The applicable inference pattern is denying the consequent, which we’ve learned is a valid form of deductive inference. Scientists whose observations defy their expectations should reason that something is amiss. If a hypothesis guarantees some expectation will occur, and then the observation violates the expectation, one can deductively conclude the hypothesis is false. In other words, the mismatch between expected and actual observations refutes the hypothesis. When Hubble observed a distinctive pattern in stars’ redshift—those further away had more redshift—this enabled him to reject the hypothesis that the universe was in a steady state.

Sometimes, of course, observations do match the expectations. This is a good sign about the hypothesis. Careful, though! If the observations and expectations match, and we conclude the hypothesis must be true, this follows the inference pattern of affirming the consequent, which is an invalid form of deductive inference. So, if observations match expectations, this does not enable a valid deductive argument for the hypothesis. Think of it this way. A match between expectations and observations is consistent with the truth of the hypothesis, sure, but it does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. We can think of this nondeductive inference as confirmation: the observation matches the expectation based on the hypothesis, providing evidence in favor of the hypothesis.

##### Confirmation

1. If H, then E
2. E
3. ∴ Probably or possibly H

If the evidence matches expectations, the hypothesis is confirmed; if not, it’s refuted. The H‐D method identifies an important difference in the logic of confirmation versus refutation. Refutation of a hypothesis is deductively valid and thus certain, while confirmation of a hypothesis is not. This is why we included “probably or possibly” in the previous argument form for confirmation.

When Hubble observed a distinctive pattern in the redshift of stars, he hypothesized that the universe is expanding. That would lead us to expect that more distant stars have a greater redshift, as they are moving away from us more quickly than stars closer by. This expectation matches Hubble’s observation, and so confirms the hypothesis. But perhaps there’s some other reason for this observation. Scientists needed to look for additional evidence supporting the hypothesis that the universe was expanding.

A very simple example can help illustrate this point about the different logic of refutation and confirmation. Consider the hypothesis that all swans are white. If this hypothesis is true, then the swan you observe next will be white. This is a true conditional statement: the antecedent’s truth guarantees the truth of the consequent. So, you go out looking for swans, with the expectation that, if your hypothesis is true, you will see a white one. Let’s say you instead encounter a black swan. This observation violates your expectation; by denying the consequent, you’ve shown the antecedent (the hypothesis) is false. Breaking news: it’s not the case that all swans are white! However, if the next swan you see is white, then your observation matches the expectation. You haven’t proven anything, but you do have a bit more evidence in favor of the hypothesis.

The H‐D method thus posits a crucial difference between refutation and confirmation. Refutation is a valid deductive inference proving the hypothesis is false. In contrast, the logical structure of confirmation is a deductively invalid inference. Thus, we are not warranted in concluding the hypothesis is certainly true but only that it probably or possibly is. An observation matching what a hypothesis leads us to expect usually provides some evidence for the hypothesis, but this isn’t always so, and it’s surprisingly tricky to articulate how this works.

##### The case of puerperal fever

The philosopher Carl Hempel famously invoked the story of Ignaz Semmelweis to illustrate the H‐D method. Semmelweis was a doctor working in the First Maternity Division of the Vienna General Hospital in the 1840s. At that time, many birthing women contracted a serious—even fatal—illness known as puerperal or “child-bed” fever. (Puerperium refers to the postpartum period following labor and delivery.) A puzzling observation was that the mortality rate in the First Maternity Division was approximately three times higher than in the adjacent Second Maternity Division. These rates are shown in Table 6.1.

What accounted for the difference between the two wards? Semmelweis made several interesting observations. Women with extremely long dilation periods died of puerperal fever more often; patients in the first ward fell ill in a sequential manner, one after another; and neither patients’ health nor their caretakers’ skill seemed related to the incidence of puerperal fever. Finally, not only was the illness rate in the second ward lower, but women who instead gave birth at home or elsewhere outside the clinic—even unattended on the street—did not suffer from puerperal fever.

Semmelweis used these observations to rule out several possible sources of illness. If puerperal fever were a citywide epidemic, then women laboring outside the hospital would also suffer from the illness—but they didn’t. If puerperal fever were triggered by psychological concerns during childbirth, like intense modesty from being medically examined by male doctors (as had been proposed), then women delivering in the streets should also experience puerperal fever—but they didn’t. Further, all of the proposed sources of illness led to the expectation of equal rates of the illness in the first and second maternity wards, but that expectation didn’t match observations. As in the H-D method of refutation, Semmelweis rejected these hypotheses about the origin of puerperal fever.

Semmelweis also tried to develop hypotheses that were consistent with the observed difference in puerperal fever rates between the two wards. One difference between them was male doctors and medical students staffed the first ward, whereas female midwives staffed the second ward. Women in the first ward also gave birth on their backs, while women in the second ward gave birth on their sides. Semmelweis changed procedures in the first ward so that all women there also gave birth on their sides. If giving birth on one’s back increases incidence of the puerperal fever, then that changed position will decrease incidence of puerperal fever. Alas, this expectation didn’t match Semmelweis’s observation: changing birth position in the first ward made no difference. Other hypotheses were similarly tested and ruled out.

In March 1847, Semmelweis learned that his colleague Jakob Kolletschka had died. Kolletschka was a professor of forensic medicine and had been performing an autopsy when a scalpel had lacerated his finger. Kolletschka had then exhibited the same symptoms as the mothers and infants who died of puerperal fever. Although distraught, Semmelweis also recognized the significance of this information for his investigation. He hypothesized that the scalpel had contaminated Kolletschka’s blood with “cadaverous particles,” which had caused puerperal fever leading to his death.

Semmelweis’s hypothesis fit with the observed difference in illness rates between the two wards: doctors and medical students performed autopsies, whereas midwives did not. If cadaverous particles from autopsies caused puerperal fever, then only births attended by doctors and medical students who had performed autopsies would result in puerperal fever. In fact, much higher rates were observed in the ward attended by doctors and medical students, confirming this hypothesis.

Semmelweis reasoned that if the hypothesis that cadaverous particles caused puerperal fever were true, then the illness could be prevented by eliminating the particles. To test his hypothesis, he required all doctors, medical students, and midwives to wash their hands in a solution of chlorinated lime prior to examining patients. If this made no difference, then cadaverous particles weren’t to blame—the hypothesis would be refuted. Instead, the mortality rate from puerperal fever began to decrease, and the incidence of illness in the first and second wards became similar.

As described here, this case involves many instances of the H-D method, and it illustrates the logical difference between refutation and confirmation. On the H-D account, refutation is decisive because it results from a valid deductive inference, while confirmation is logically weaker. And, as it turns out, Semmelweis’s confirmed hypothesis was incorrect: puerperal fever does not originate from cadaverous material but from uterine bacterial infection. Luckily, chlorinated lime has antibacterial properties. Semmelweis thought the prescribed handwashing worked because it removed cadaverous material; instead, it worked because it removed bacteria. (The role of bacteria in illness was not yet widely accepted.)

Some other important instances of hypothesis‐testing are also well captured by the H‐D method. In Chapter 3, we discussed Arthur Eddington’s confirmation of Einstein’s theory of relativity from the 1919 solar eclipse as a crucial experiment, decisively adjudicating between two hypotheses. This is because the experiment refuted Newton’s cosmological theory while fitting with Einstein’s new theory. Measuring how much light bends around the Sun enabled Eddington to refute Newton’s theory and confirm Einstein’s.

#### Auxiliary assumptions

The hypothetico‐deductive (H‐D) method captures something important about hypothesis‐testing in science, namely, the distinctive power of refutation. Data that fit our expectations are well and good, but we can really learn something from data that go against our expectations. This accords with the importance of falsifiable hypotheses, too—hypotheses must be at risk of refutation in order to have the potential to be confirmed by evidence. The power of refutation is also what makes the idea of crucial experiments compelling, as with Eddington’s test of Einstein’s new theory of relativity against Newton’s reigning theory.

However, the H‐D method also has its limitations. One limitation is that inferences from hypotheses to expectations are never genuinely deductive. Additional claims are needed to make a deductive inference from hypothesis to expectation valid. These additional claims are auxiliary assumptions: assumptions about how the world works that often go unnoticed but that are needed for a hypothesis or theory to have the expected implications. In Chapter 3, we stressed the role of background knowledge in shaping expectations; this is the same point. Lurking in the background of Semmelweis’s inference about handwashing, for example, was the assumption that handwashing would remove cadaverous material. Behind Eddington’s refutation of Newtonian physics were numerous assumptions about the behavior of instruments, the properties of light, the location of certain astral bodies, and more.

Auxiliary assumptions often go unnoticed. Sometimes, this is because an auxiliary assumption is assumed to be true; other times, no one has even noticed the assumption is needed. But, because valid deductive inference requires the premises to guarantee the conclusion, any auxiliary assumptions are essential for the deductive inference from a hypothesis to some expectation, a key component of the H‐D method. But this also impacts the conclusions one can draw. So, the schemes identified earlier for refutation and confirmation on the H‐D account need to be adjusted:

| Refutation             | Confirmation                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| (1) If H and A, then E | (1) If H and A, then E               |
| (2) Not E              | (2) E                                |
| ∴ (3) Not (H and A)    | ∴ (3) Probably or possibly (H and A) |

In this new formulation, A stands for whatever auxiliary assumptions are required as additional premises to validly deduce E from H. These may include background knowledge about the phenomenon under investigation, information about the reliability of experimental instruments and measurement procedures, and more. But taking into account auxiliary assumptions means that all we can deductively include in refutation is that it’s not the case that both H and A are true—either the hypothesis is false or an auxiliary assumption is false (or both). Given the need for auxiliary assumptions, the H-D method cannot be used to conclusively determine that the hypothesis is false.

This problem relates to underdetermination, introduced in Chapter 3 as the idea the evidence may not be sufficient to determine which of multiple hypotheses is true. This variety of underdetermination is known as the Duhem-Quine problem, the idea that scientific hypotheses can never be tested in isolation but only against the background of auxiliary assumptions. The Duhem-Quine problem is named after the 19th-century French physicist, mathematician, and philosopher Pierre Duhem and the 20th-century American philosopher Willard van Orman Quine, who both emphasized this challenge.

One consequence of the Duhem-Quine problem is that deductive logic alone is insufficient for successful hypothesis-testing. In the face of refutation, scientists need to decide whether to give up on a hypothesis or to question their auxiliary assumptions. This seems to involve an element of choice. In the face of refutation, scientists may well want to hold on to a hypothesis they like and search for other explanations for why the observations didn’t turn out as expected. This makes the logic of refutation more similar to that of confirmation: neither is fully decisive.

That said, there are some guidelines for whether to reject a hypothesis in the face of refutation or instead blame an auxiliary assumption. Usually, scientists have independent evidence for many of their auxiliary assumptions. Instruments and measurement procedures have been tested and calibrated, and background knowledge about a phenomenon is based on evidence or commonsense. These considerations can help scientists decide how much to trust auxiliary assumptions and thus whether, and when, to reject the hypothesis under investigation. A refutation may also spur additional tests of auxiliary assumptions before a verdict about whether to reject the hypothesis.

Nonetheless, the need for auxiliary assumptions limits the power of the H-D method of hypothesis-testing. The Duhem-Quine problem makes clear that, just like confirmation, refutation is messier than simple deductive inference.

### 6.4 AXIOMATIC METHODS AND MODELING

After reading this section, you should be able to:

- Characterize the axiomatic method and indicate how it is used in science
- Articulate how deductive inference is used in mathematical modeling
- Describe how non‐Euclidean geometry and the James Webb Space Telescope exemplify roles of deductive reasoning in science

#### Axiomatic methods

Deductive inference plays special roles in some fields of science. Progress in scientific reasoning is sometimes achieved through formal axiomatization, a constructive procedure by which statements are derived from foundational principles. The foundational principles, called axioms, are accepted as self‐evident truths about some domain. A set of axioms is then used to deductively infer other truths about the domain, called theorems.

The most venerable example of axiomatization comes from the Greek mathematician Euclid, working around 300 BCE. Euclid’s Elements of Geometry begins with 23 definitions and five axioms. The five axioms are the following:

1. A straight line may be drawn between any two points.
2. Any terminated straight line may be extended indefinitely.
3. A circle may be drawn with any given point as center and any given radius.
4. All right angles are equal.
5. If two straight lines in a plane are met by another line, and if the sum of the internal angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the straight lines will meet if extended sufficiently on the side on which the sum of the angles is less than two right angles.

Together, these five axioms serve as the theoretical core of Euclidean geometry.

Figure 6.4 shows a fragment—one of the oldest on record—containing a diagram that accompanies the fifth axiom of Book II of the Euclid’s Elements.

Using this set of axioms as premises, one can validly deduce theorems about the congruency of figures, parallel lines, and other results of Euclidean geometry. In turn, these theorems can be treated as premises in new arguments aimed at validly deducing new theorems.

Euclid’s axiomatization of geometry was accepted as decisive for almost two millennia. This is a clear example of rigorous inference grounded in first principles, with the power to systematize all existing knowledge of geometry. Euclid’s axiomatization of geometry deeply influenced Ibn al‐Haytham’s work in optics and Newton’s physical theory of mechanics.

And yet, beginning in the 19th century, nonclassical geometries were developed that diverge from Euclid’s axiomatization. These arose from questioning the fifth axiom of Euclidean geometry. The fifth axiom is notably more complicated and less intuitive than the other axioms, and over centuries, many scholars tried to prove this principle as a theorem from the other axioms. None succeeded. Mathematicians working in the early 19th century then developed different geometries by introducing deviations from Euclid’s fifth axiom. Just as Euclid’s geometry was central to earlier developments in mathematics, physics and astronomy, these non‐Euclidean geometries paved the way for Einstein’s radical new theories of the relativity of space and time. Einstein’s theories of relativity imply that the geometry of physical space itself is generally not Euclidean. A principle accepted as mathematical certainty for millennia was then rejected as not in general true. (Einstein’s theories do entail that geometry here on Earth is approximately Euclidean, though.)

Another example of the axiomatic method concerns the foundations of arithmetic. Concerned with questions about the exact nature of numbers, the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano employed axiomatic reasoning to give a rigorous foundation for the natural numbers (that is, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .). Peano’s axiomatization of natural numbers began with three primitive concepts not defined in terms of other concepts. Peano thought these primitive concepts are self‐evident: the set of natural numbers, N; the number zero, a member of the set N; and the successor function S. This successor function can be applied to any natural number, and it will yield the next number after it. For example, S(6) = 7. Likewise, S(0) = 1. From here, Peano laid down several axioms:

1. Zero is a number.
2. If n is a number, then S(n) is a number.
3. Zero is not the successor of a number.
4. Distinct natural numbers have distinct successors.
5. If 0 is an element in a set of numbers and the successor of every number is in that set, then every number is in that set.

From these axioms, the basic properties of natural numbers could be described, and theorems about them, including arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction, could be deduced. To take a simple example, the supposition that there is a number preceding zero (S(k) = 0) would contradict axiom (3). Accordingly, the theorem that zero has no predecessor in N can be derived from axiom (3).

#### Deductive reasoning in mathematical modeling

This chapter began with a consideration of how Hubble reasoned from astronomical discoveries to conclusions about the size, expansion, and age of the universe. The newest chapter of the story of such cosmological discovery is the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in December 2021.

JWST is the successor to the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes, and it is the most powerful deep space observatory ever built. Among its main goals is the delivery of data about mid‐infrared light with wavelengths up to 28,000 nanometers; scientists can use that data to reason about the beginning of the universe—especially the epoch of reionization, when stars began to generate light. JWST will also investigate galactic and stellar formation and evolution, and it will measure atmospheric chemistry to search various planetary systems for the conditions that make life possible.

Constructing and launching JWST was an amazing feat of human ingenuity and effort. The endeavor is an excellent example of fruitful collaboration between vocational, scientific, and philosophical disciplines. One of the many challenges to be worked out was the path JWST should take after its launch.

Theoretical resources used to answer that question come from mathematician and astronomer Leonhard Euler and his student Joseph‐Louis Lagrange, who in the 19th century explored mathematical solutions to what has come to be called “the three‐body problem.” In physics, this is the challenge of how the position, momentum, and gravitation of three celestial bodies affects the movement of each through space. There is no general solution to the three‐body problem; there’s no equation you can plug these values into and calculate the results. But a few special cases have been solved. These include when two of the bodies are motionless, and also when one of the three bodies is nearly massless relative to two massive orbiting bodies—such as a spacecraft, star, and planet.

Euler and Lagrange discovered five solutions for this special case of one nearly massless body and two massive orbiting bodies. These solutions are now known as Lagrange points. Lagrange points are regions of space where the gravitational pull of the two massive orbiting bodies is identical to the force needed for the nearly massless body to move with them. These points can be used to keep a spacecraft in position with less energy. In the Sun/Earth system, for the first three solutions (L1, L2, L3), the bodies are linearly aligned and the last two (L4 and L5) are the apices of equilateral triangles; collectively, these form what looks like a “peace” sign. Sending JWST to a Lagrange point offered a way to keep JWST “tethered” to the Sun and Earth, in a sense; that is, to use the gravitational force of those two bodies to speed JWST in its journey.

In January 2022, JWST journeyed to L2, which is approximately 1.5 million kilometers beyond the dark side of the Earth. In L2, JWST could harvest energy on its Sun‐facing side, helping to reduce fuel needs, and this also enabled reliable communication back to Earth. But if JWST overshot L2, it would have to be abandoned or returned to Earth, exposing sensitive instrumentation to solar radiation and heat in the process. And if JWST undershot L2, it would not be able to get into a stable position. So, mid‐course correction maneuvers were required to exactly reach L2. To determine the necessary course corrections, NASA scientists had to build models simulating the vectors of various thrusts in a state space. Computer simulations were used to help visualize these models, but the models themselves were essentially logical derivations from equations. These derivations enabled scientists to reason deductively about what consequences to expect from potential changes. Ultimately, scientists used these models to settle on three mid‐course correction maneuvers: one immediately after launch for redirection, another just before sunshield deployment, and the final correction to insert JWST into its L2 orbit.

At L2, the force required to keep JWST in position was minimized by the balance between Earth’s and Sun’s gravitational pull. But our solar system is not actually a three‐body system. There’s also our moon’s mass and gravitational pull to contend with, among other forces, and so the orbital stability of L2 is imperfect. Even minuscule deviations from equilibrium will tend to increase over time; think of a fishtailing trailer or skateboard that eventually crashes. If such deviations were left uncorrected, JWST would just wander out of L2. So, the question rises anew: how can scientists maintain JWST’s location over time while keeping it oriented so as to provide an unoccluded view of deep space?

NASA scientists modeled the range of possible perturbations of different orbital trajectories, examined what would result from these increasing changes without intervention, and then predicted the possible corrections to those curvatures that would allow them to maintain JWST’s position. Again, these geometric and topological models involve deductive inference from various formulae to predict the consequences of various trajectories around L2. For these reasons, JWST is not actually at L2. The halo motion the scientists settled on has it moving in a very wide, tilted, and slow elliptical orbit around L2. These mathematical models also demonstrated the need for throttle adjustments or “burns” every three weeks to correct for things like rotational torque and other small perturbations. The calculations involved in determining the timing and duration of these burns again requires scientists to reason deductively from their models.

These theoretical resources and calculations required to support the position and movement of the James Webb Space Telescope in space illustrate another way in which deductive reasoning is used in science. In any scientific research, inferential reasoning is needed to connect empirical investigation to conclusions. But the role of deductive reasoning is even more central to some scientific research. This includes the mathematical modeling used to inform the management of JWST and the axiomatic methods at the heart of the development of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries.
