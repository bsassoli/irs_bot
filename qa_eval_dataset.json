It can lead to some gnarly symptoms, including dehydration, vomiting, difficult breathing, and odd fits of snapping or chomping. As the condition worsens, infected dogs can suffer grand mal seizures followed by death.",

Most want effective prevention and treatment for their pets and, if they hear of canine distemper, follow expert veterinary advice.
