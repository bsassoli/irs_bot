A hypothesis is a conjectural statement based on limited data\u2014a guess about what some aspect of the world is like, which is not (yet) backed by sufficient, or perhaps any, evidence.

What if some salt is already dissolved in the water; should we still expect the sample of salt to dissolve?",

        "doc_349": "Making observations, and collecting data as records of those observations, is at the heart of science\u2019s ability to generate knowledge of our world. But observations aren\u2019t always independent from the ideas about the world we already have. Changes in what we believe to be true can have significant impact on what we observe. For instance, when we observe the Sun at the horizon, what we seem to see is the Sun at one point on its path across the sky. Geocentricism, the historically dominant idea that the Earth",
        "doc_350": "the historically dominant idea that the Earth is the center of the universe, organizes this and similar observations into an easily understood pattern, and those observations confirm geocentrism. But from the perspective of heliocentrism\u2014the idea that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun\u2014once your head is slightly turned to the side, the Sun at the horizon and the other planetary bodies that appear comprise a different observation. Figure 2.4 schematically diagrams this conceptual shift.",

It may also create a different perceptual experience: instead of the Sun moving below the horizon as it sets, your position on Earth rotates away from the Sun. New ideas can sometimes have a strong effect on what we think we see. Thus, observations are a crucial ingredient of science, but they aren\u2019t passive, aren\u2019t always the starting point, and aren\u2019t always decisive.  \nEXERCISES",

        "doc_917": "Constructing and analyzing a model shares some similarities with experimentation. Both experimenters and modelers perform interventions to test expectations based on a hypothesis; like experiments, modeling can provide evidence for or against hypotheses about target systems. Expectations about the consequences of the Reber plan for the San Francisco Bay were tested with interventions on the Bay model. Animal models like the fruit fly are used to test expectations about the genetic causes of human diseases,",
        "doc_918": "about the genetic causes of human diseases, like diabetes and lymphoma. And studying the iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma helps test expectations about the conditions that enable cooperative behavior to emerge among self\u2010interested individuals.",
        "doc_919": "In each example, the models were used to test scientists\u2019 hypotheses about real\u2010world systems, sometimes with surprising results. So, models can play a role similar to experiments. One important difference is that, with experiments, scientists intervene directly on the target system, whereas with models, interventions to models are used to draw conclusions about the target system. This is why models must accurately represent their targets.",
        "doc_920": "Getting models to reflect their targets more accurately is a primary task of modeling. When a model is known to accurately represent its target, it can play a role similar to a scientific theory by representing core features of that phenomenon. When a model behaves similarly to the expected target system(s) in many instances and across different circumstances, it may become accepted as part of a theory of how the target behaves. An example of such a theoretical use of modeling is the Lotka-Volterra model",
        "doc_921": "use of modeling is the Lotka-Volterra model of predator-prey interactions. If one sets the model\u2019s parameters based on observations or estimates of specific predator and prey populations, one can then use the model to predict changes over time in the sizes of these populations. These predictions are a good account of how real predator-prey populations behave, and when they go wrong, one can usually figure out why by comparing the model\u2019s features to the target system\u2019s features.",
        "doc_922": "So, models can play an experimental role by helping to investigate phenomena empirically, and they can play a theoretical role by providing an account of phenomena. Sometimes the same model can even play both experimental and theoretical roles. In Axelrod\u2019s tournament, computer simulations served as virtual environments to test which strategies would perform best in an iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma game. While there were no expectations that Tit-for-Tat would win, this outcome accorded with an existing",
        "doc_923": "would win, this outcome accorded with an existing theory in evolutionary biology, namely reciprocal altruism. The basic idea is that it can be evolutionarily advantageous for an organism to help another at some cost to itself if there is a chance the favor will be returned in the future. The success of Tit-for-Tat was based on reciprocity, and so was consistent with this theory. Thus, the success of Tit-for-Tat in Axelrod\u2019s computer tournament confirmed the idea in evolutionary theory that natural",
        "doc_924": "the idea in evolutionary theory that natural selection can favor cooperative behavior, even when there are costs, if the behavior is reciprocal.",
        "doc_925": "Common features of models",
        "doc_926": "This chapter has emphasized how different models can be from one another. Still, all models share three important features. First, all scientific models are used to learn about the world. Data models represent data to enable hypothesis-testing. Constructing and investigating models of phenomena enable scientists to reason about target system(s) in hopes of gaining new scientific knowledge. In both cases, the models are used as vehicles for learning about natural phenomena investigated in science.",
        "doc_927": "Second, all models are used to represent: they are about, or stand for, the phenomena they target\u2014or, for data models, the data they characterize. For a model to represent a target, it must be like the target in the right ways. Often, this likeness is understood in terms of similarity. But we have said that models aren\u2019t exactly like the target systems they represent; they are also dissimilar from their targets in important ways\u2014smaller or larger, mathematical or computerized. What similarities and",
        "doc_928": "or computerized. What similarities and differences are intended between a model and a target governs how the model should be interpreted and used.",
        "doc_929": "Third, all scientific models involve idealization and abstraction. When constructing a model, scientists leave out some features of the target system and incorporate features the target does not have. Omitting or ignoring known features of the system is called abstraction. Misrepresenting features of the system with false assumptions is idealization (defined earlier). Abstraction and idealization can be used to set aside or simplify some features of target systems to focus on only those features deemed",
        "doc_930": "systems to focus on only those features deemed important for the purposes at hand.",
        "doc_931": "The Lotka-Volterra model, for example, abstracts away from properties of prey and predators, like their speed, size, and capacity for camouflage. Those features aren\u2019t essential to how predator-prey interactions influence population size and so have been abstracted, or removed, from the model. The Lotka-Volterra model also incorporates idealizations of predator-prey interactions. That model\u2019s idealizations include the assumptions that prey can always find food, that predators are always hungry, and that",
        "doc_932": "food, that predators are always hungry, and that both predators and prey are moving randomly through a homogenous environment. Scientists know these assumptions aren\u2019t true, but they are helpful simplifications that usually don\u2019t interfere with the model\u2019s usefulness.",
        "doc_933": "These three features of scientific models\u2014their use to learn about natural phenomena, their representation of target system(s), and their incorporation of abstractions and idealizations\u2014all relate to one another. Abstraction and idealization are features of models that affect how they represent their targets, and the ways models represent their targets partly determines what can be learned from them. Representation, then, is at the heart of scientific modeling.  \nWhat makes a model good?",
        "doc_934": "We\u2019ve seen that a target system can be represented in many ways. A physical model of a hydrological system, like the Bay model, represents water flow in ways that differ from mathematical models of fluid dynamics. And both of those are different from the computer model that eventually took over the work of the Bay model. There\u2019s no one perfect model of a given phenomenon. Instead, the goodness of a model is determined by what the modelers want to learn from the model. Other factors, such as cost or ease of",
        "doc_935": "the model. Other factors, such as cost or ease of developing or using the model, can also be important. Sometimes one model will be enough for learning about a target system; other times, multiple models of the same target will be necessary to gain knowledge.",
        "doc_936": "It is desirable for models to be accurate, general, precise, tractable, and robust. Each of these features helps make a model valuable, but attempting to maximize all of these features is futile. This is because these features trade off against one another: gaining more of one desirable feature of a model often requires losing ground on some other desirable features. For example, a model that is more general by applying to more target systems is also often less accurate of any one target system. This is",
        "doc_937": "less accurate of any one target system. This is because targets differ from one another in some regards. So, when constructing models, scientists must decide which desirable features to emphasize and which to compromise on.",
        "doc_938": "Box 5.1 Values in Modeling",
        "doc_939": "Models always are similar to their target systems\u2014but are also different from them in various ways. This creates an opportunity, or an inevitability, really, for the influence of social values on scientific modeling. Recall from Chapter 2 that social values are the priorities and moral principles accepted in some community. One way social values influence modeling is in shaping what features of a target system scientists choose to represent accurately in a model and what features they ignore or distort.",
        "doc_940": "a model and what features they ignore or distort. These choices depend on modelers\u2019 aims. The influence of values on these choices is salient especially (but not only) for models in social science, as how a phenomenon should be defined and measured given a certain purpose and what factors are important to understand often relate closely to social values.",
        "doc_941": "For example, philosopher of science Eric Winsberg has criticized predictive models of the Covid-19 pandemic that were used to justify governmental stay-at-home orders for including consideration of illness and death from Covid-19 but excluding consideration of the health impacts of school closures, social isolation, and deferred healthcare. There\u2019s not one single right way to develop a model. What\u2019s important is that similarities and differences from a target system be thoughtfully designed and open to",
        "doc_942": "system be thoughtfully designed and open to scrutiny from others. Multiple models of one target phenomenon also can be developed; this was done for models of the Covid-19 pandemic, and it also occurs in climate change modeling and modeling of many other phenomena of widespread social importance. Multiple models of the same target can lay bare how modeling choices based on different aims and values influence what we understand about a phenomenon.",
        "doc_943": "Accuracy",
        "doc_944": "Accuracy is the extent to which a model represents the actual features of its target system; models that are more accurate better represent more features of a target system. A model that represented all and only the actual features of its target would be maximally accurate, but maximal accuracy is unhelpful; recall that models are improved by some differences from their targets. For example, the Bay model improved its representation of water flow by introducing inaccuracies of water depth. Overemphasizing",
        "doc_945": "inaccuracies of water depth. Overemphasizing a model\u2019s accuracy can come at significant costs to tractability and generality\u2014making the model difficult to develop and inapplicable to target systems that differ in minor ways.",
        "doc_946": "Generality",
        "doc_947": "Generality is a model\u2019s applicability to a greater number of target systems; a model is more general when it applies to a greater number of target systems. Generality is a desirable feature of models insofar as it enables models to be reused in various circumstances. General models also highlight what various phenomena have in common with one another. Because the prisoner\u2019s dilemma can apply to nations, squirrels, and pirates, this is a general model with numerous applications. This generality reveals",
        "doc_948": "numerous applications. This generality reveals something that these scenarios have in common: repeated interactions can enable cooperation to spontaneously emerge. However, sacrificing some generality in a model can be worthwhile, depending on the aim of the model, if this enables the model to represent its target more accurately. A general prisoner\u2019s dilemma model might be supplemented with information about, say, how natural selection favors bacteria that can persist near one another (a form of",
        "doc_949": "that can persist near one another (a form of cooperation). The resulting model will give more insight into bacteria cooperation in virtue of this additional detail. But it also will be less general\u2014it will no longer apply to humans or corporations. Which is better depends on the modelers\u2019 aims.",
        "doc_950": "Precision is the extent to which a model finely specifies features of a target system; a more precise model more finely specifies features of the target. For example, climate models that allow scientists to predict how much warmer the global average temperature will be in 30 years within a range of \u00b10.05\u00b0 Celsius are more precise than models that allow them to predict a \u00b11\u00b0 Celsius range of temperature increase in 30 years. Notice that precision is different from accuracy. Whereas accuracy is a matter of a",
        "doc_951": "from accuracy. Whereas accuracy is a matter of a value\u2019s proximity to the true value, precision is a matter of how finely specified a value is. So, a model can be very precise but inaccurate. Think of an archer loosing arrows at a target. Arrows that are scattered all around the bull\u2019s eye but near it are accurate but imprecise. Arrows that are tightly clustered together but off center, away from the bull\u2019s eye, are precise but inaccurate (see Figure 5.9).",
        "doc_952": "Greater precision benefits a model by enabling it to give a more specific characterization of its target and to make more specific predictions. But increasing precision usually comes at the cost of a model\u2019s generality, its tractability, and sometimes its accuracy. Highly precise models are less generally applicable and more difficult to develop. And, the more specific a prediction is, the easier it is for that prediction to be incorrect.",
        "doc_953": "Tractability is the degree of ease in developing or using a model. More tractable models are easier to construct, manipulate, or analyze. This may involve different considerations, like the time it takes to run a model on a computer, whether the equations of a mathematical model have exact solutions, or even whether a modeler happens to be already familiar with one approach but not another. For example, because the iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma involves agents having repeated encounters, this model is less",
        "doc_954": "having repeated encounters, this model is less tractable than the original prisoner\u2019s dilemma. One consequence of this decreased tractability is that scientists know exactly what the possible outcomes are for the original prisoner\u2019s dilemma, but they cannot easily predict the outcomes for the iterated version. This is why Axelrod ran a computer tournament to explore some of the possible outcomes. Tractability is never maximized, though: the easiest thing to accomplish is nothing at all, and more",
        "doc_955": "thing to accomplish is nothing at all, and more complicated models regularly result in more accurate, precise, and useful findings. For instance, the iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma reveals how repeat encounters can overcome the dilemma, making cooperation directly beneficial.",
        "doc_956": "Robustness is a measure of insensitivity to features that differ between a model and the target system, including abstractions and idealizations. Normally, scientists don\u2019t want their model\u2019s predictions to be influenced by those features, since they aren\u2019t shared by the target. So, a more robust model is one that changes less despite variation in its assumptions. But limited robustness is inevitable. Models incorporate assumptions, including idealizations, that are needed for them to do the tasks they are",
        "doc_957": "that are needed for them to do the tasks they are designed for. If they didn\u2019t matter, they wouldn\u2019t be needed. What scientists aim to avoid is overreliance on specific assumptions that are unlikely to be true or even known to be false. Multiple models are sometimes used to determine how robust a model\u2019s predictions are. If different models, with different assumptions, predict roughly the same result, that prediction seems more trustworthy than if it had been generated by just one model with uncertain",
        "doc_958": "been generated by just one model with uncertain assumptions and parameters. This is robustness analysis, introduced in section 5.2.",
        "doc_959": "There is no single answer to how a model should best incorporate these desirable features, nor is there a perfect tradeoff among the features. Instead, scientists strategically develop their models to be tractable enough for their current circumstances; robust enough to be certain to some reasonable degree; accurate and precise enough to make interesting, trustworthy predictions; and general enough to be enlightening across the range of phenomena they are interested in.

The philosopher Aristotle argued that the universe must be eternal. He reasoned that everything which comes into existence requires some preexisting matter from which it comes.

This implies that if the universe came into existence, then it came into existence from some",

        "doc_971": "From the early Middle Ages to the end of the Renaissance, roughly the 7th through 16th centuries, scholars and theologians in Europe, the Mediterranean Basin, and the Middle East continued to engage with questions about the age of the universe.

These discoveries also provided new evidence about the age of the universe.",
        "doc_974": "Using a telescope with a 2.5\u2010meter aperture at Mount Wilson Observatory in Southern California, Hubble observed Andromeda, an astronomical entity visible to the naked eye and identified over 1,000 years ago. He saw stars similar to those nearer to Earth, only dimmer. One of those stars is called a Cepheid variable, a star whose brightness changes periodically. The period of time it takes a Cepheid\u2019s brightness to change is related to the star\u2019s luminosity, the amount of energy it emits in one second.",

Hubble then used his knowledge of the speed of light, which Einstein had recently shown to be constant, and the apparent brightness of the star compared to what he had calculated to be its luminosity to calculate the star\u2019s distance from Earth. Based on the distance of that star, Hubble reasoned that Andromeda is actually a different galaxy from our",

To have a valid inference, the truth of the premises must logically force the conclusion to be true; there must be no way around having a true conclusion if the premises are true.

The study of logic is deeply related to mathematics and computer science, where researchers also explore formal relations between sets of claims.

Both rules are valid, since the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.",

Ideas expressed in natural language can sometimes be interpreted in different ways. This means there are choices to make in how to define the precise rules of formal logic. Different choices result in different systems of formal logic.",
        "doc_1037": "For instance, the most common logic system, called classical logic, has an assumption called the law of the excluded middle. This law stipulates that, for every claim, either the claim is true or its negation is true. For example, if it is not true that the grass is green, then it is true that the grass is not green. In many cases, the excluded-middle assumption accurately reflects how we reason in natural language. But sometimes it seems to go wrong. For example, it\u2019s not obvious that, if it\u2019s not true",

Perhaps it\u2019s sprinkling out, but we wouldn\u2019t yet call it rain. Other systems of logic make different assumptions to recognize this possibility, making it possible for a sentence to be neither true nor false or a sentence to be both true and false. These systems of nonclassical logic thus reject the law of the excluded middle.",
        "doc_1039": "So invalid arguments can have true premises and conclusions, while valid arguments can have false premises and conclusions. Successful deductive inferences are those that combine both validity and truth. A sound inference is a valid deductive inference with all true premises.

These points can be used to keep a spacecraft in position with less energy. In the Sun/Earth system, for the first three solutions (L1, L2, L3), the",
        "doc_1152": "for the first three solutions (L1, L2, L3), the bodies are linearly aligned and the last two (L4 and L5) are the apices of equilateral triangles; collectively, these form what looks like a \u201cpeace\u201d sign. Sending JWST to a Lagrange point offered a way to keep JWST \u201ctethered\u201d to the Sun and Earth, in a sense; that is, to use the gravitational force of those two bodies to speed JWST in its journey.",
        "doc_1153": "In January 2022, JWST journeyed to L2, which is approximately 1.5 million kilometers beyond the dark side of the Earth. In L2, JWST could harvest energy on its Sun\u2010facing side, helping to reduce fuel needs, and this also enabled reliable communication back to Earth. But if JWST overshot L2, it would have to be abandoned or returned to Earth, exposing sensitive instrumentation to solar radiation and heat in the process. And if JWST undershot L2, it would not be able to get into a stable position. So,",

To determine the necessary course corrections, NASA scientists had to build models simulating the vectors of various thrusts in a state space. Computer simulations were used to help visualize these models, but the models themselves were essentially logical derivations from equations. These derivations enabled scientists to reason deductively about what consequences to expect from potential",

Ultimately, scientists used these models to settle on three mid\u2010course correction maneuvers: one immediately after launch for redirection, another just before sunshield deployment, and the final correction to insert JWST into its L2 orbit.",

But our solar system is not actually a three\u2010body system. There\u2019s also our moon\u2019s mass and gravitational pull to contend with, among other forces, and so the orbital stability of L2 is imperfect. Even minuscule deviations from equilibrium will tend to increase over time; think of a fishtailing trailer or skateboard that eventually crashes. If such deviations were left uncorrected,",
        "doc_1157": "If such deviations were left uncorrected, JWST would just wander out of L2. So, the question rises anew: how can scientists maintain JWST\u2019s location over time while keeping it oriented so as to provide an unoccluded view of deep space?",

Again, these geometric and topological models involve deductive inference from various formulae to predict the consequences of various trajectories around L2. For these reasons, JWST is not actually at L2. The halo motion",
        "doc_1159": "JWST is not actually at L2. The halo motion the scientists settled on has it moving in a very wide, tilted, and slow elliptical orbit around L2. These mathematical models also demonstrated the need for throttle adjustments or \u201cburns\u201d every three weeks to correct for things like rotational torque and other small perturbations. The calculations involved in determining the timing and duration of these burns again requires scientists to reason deductively from their models.",
